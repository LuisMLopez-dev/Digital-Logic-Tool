# Digital-Logic-Tool WIP
This is a C program that simulates logic gates for both 1-bit comparisons and 8-bit (byte) comparisons.

## Planned Features
- 1-bit comparisons for logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR 
- 8-bit comparisons for logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR 
- Truth table generation for the logic gates mentioned above
- A clean CLI (command-line interface)

Additionally, all logic gate functions will be contained in a `.h` file for reusability and to keep the `.c` file clean and readable.
