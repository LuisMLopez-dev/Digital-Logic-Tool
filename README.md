# Digital-Logic-Tool WIP
This is a C code that simulates logic gates for 1-bit comparisons and 8-bit, or byte, comparisons.

Currently a work in progress, and I aim to have the following features:
- 1-bit comparisons for logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR 
- 8-bit comparisons for logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR 
- Truth table generation for the logic gates mentioned above
- A clean CLI, or command-line interface

Additonally, the logic gates which will use bitwise operators will be contained in a .h file for reusability, and for the readability of the .c file.
