# Digital-Logic-Tool WIP
This is a C code that simulates logic gates for both 1-bit comparisons and 8-bit (byte) comparisons.

Currently a work in progress, and I aim to have the following features:
- 1-bit comparisons for logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR 
- 8-bit comparisons for logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR 
- Truth table generation for the logic gates mentioned above
- A clean CLI, or command-line interface

Additonally, all logic gate functions will be contained in a `.h` file for reusability and to keep the `.c` file readable.
